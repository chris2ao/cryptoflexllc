# How I Built This Site with Next.js, Tailwind v4, and Claude Code

This site - the one you're reading right now - was built in a single session with Claude Code. Not a template, not a drag-and-drop builder. Real code, real decisions, real deployment. Here's how it came together and what I learned.

## The Stack

| Technology | Why |
|---|---|
| **Next.js 15** | App Router with server components by default - faster pages, simpler data fetching |
| **React 19** | Latest React with server component support |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | New version: all config lives in CSS via `@theme` blocks. No more `tailwind.config.ts` |
| **shadcn/ui** | Copies real component source code into your project. You own it, you can modify it |
| **MDX** | Blog posts as Markdown files with embedded React components. No database needed |

## The Big Decision: Tailwind v4

If you've used Tailwind before, v4 is a significant change. The configuration that used to live in `tailwind.config.ts` now lives directly in your CSS:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-primary: var(--primary);
  /* ... */
}
```

All your design tokens - colors, fonts, spacing, border radii - are defined as CSS variables in `:root` and bridged to Tailwind utilities via the `@theme` block. It's actually simpler once you get used to it.

## Dark Mode: All In

I didn't want a light/dark toggle. The site is dark mode, period. One line in the root layout makes this happen:

```tsx
<html lang="en" className="dark">
```

The color palette uses the **OKLCH color space** - a perceptually uniform system where colors with the same lightness value actually look equally bright to human eyes. The accent color is a cyan at `oklch(0.75 0.15 195)`.

Key colors:

| Role | Value | What It Looks Like |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| Background | `oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823)` | Near-black with a subtle blue tint |
| Foreground | `oklch(0.985 0 0)` | Almost white |
| Primary | `oklch(0.75 0.15 195)` | Cyan - the accent everywhere |
| Card | `oklch(0.178 0.005 285.823)` | Slightly lighter than background |
| Border | `oklch(1 0 0 / 10%)` | Semi-transparent white - subtle |

## The Component Architecture

### Glassmorphism Nav

The sticky navigation uses a glass effect - semi-transparent background with a backdrop blur:

```tsx
<header className="sticky top-0 z-50 border-b border-border/40 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-md">
```

On mobile, the nav links collapse into a hamburger menu that opens a **Sheet** (a drawer from shadcn/ui built on Radix Dialog). It handles focus trapping, escape key, click-outside, and screen reader announcements automatically.

### The `asChild` Pattern

You'll see `asChild` throughout the code. This is a Radix pattern that means "don't render your default element - render my child instead." It's how you put button styling on a Next.js Link:

```tsx
<Button asChild size="lg">
  <Link href="/blog">Read the Blog</Link>
</Button>
```

The result is a `<a>` tag with button styling, not a `<button>` wrapping an `<a>`. Semantically correct and better for accessibility.

### The `group` Hover Pattern

Blog cards use Tailwind's `group` pattern for coordinated hover effects. Wrap the whole card in a link with `className="group"`, then any child can react to the parent hover:

```tsx
<Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} className="group">
  <Card className="hover:border-primary/50">
    <h3 className="group-hover:text-primary">
      {post.title}
    </h3>
  </Card>
</Link>
```

When you hover anywhere on the card, the title turns cyan and the border gets a subtle tint. One hover target, multiple visual responses.

## The Blog System

This is the part I'm most proud of. The blog is powered by MDX files - write Markdown, and it becomes a page on the site. No database, no CMS, no API.

### How It Works

1. **Write a file:** Drop an `.mdx` file into `src/content/blog/`
2. **Add frontmatter:** Title, date, description, tags at the top
3. **Done:** The post appears on `/blog` and gets its own page at `/blog/your-slug`

The slug comes from the filename. `my-first-post.mdx` becomes `/blog/my-first-post`.

### Under the Hood

A utility file (`lib/blog.ts`) reads all `.mdx` files at build time, parses the frontmatter with `gray-matter`, and returns sorted post data. Because this runs in a **Server Component**, there's no client-side fetch, no loading spinner, no API call. The data is baked into the HTML at build time.

Blog posts are rendered with `next-mdx-remote`, which converts MDX to React components on the server. The typography is handled by Tailwind's `prose` classes - they style headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and links without you writing any CSS.

### Static Generation

Every blog post is pre-built at compile time via `generateStaticParams()`. The result is static HTML - fast, cacheable, and SEO-friendly. When you add a new post, you push to GitHub and Vercel rebuilds automatically.

## The Contact Page Workaround

The Contact page needed to be a client component (it uses `useState` for form state). But in Next.js 15, you can't export `metadata` from a client component.

The solution: a separate `layout.tsx` that exports the metadata:

```tsx
// contact/layout.tsx - server component with metadata
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Contact",
  description: "Get in touch with Chris Johnson at CryptoFlex LLC.",
};

export default function ContactLayout({ children }) {
  return children; // Just passes through
}
```

```tsx
// contact/page.tsx - client component with form
"use client";
export default function ContactPage() {
  // ... form with useState
}
```

The layout is a server component that does nothing except provide metadata. The page is a client component with the actual form. It's a bit of a hack, but it's the official pattern.

## The Sticky Footer Trick

A common problem: on pages with little content, the footer floats in the middle of the screen instead of sticking to the bottom. The fix is three lines of Tailwind:

```tsx
<body className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
  <Nav />
  <main className="flex-1">{children}</main>
  <Footer />
</body>
```

- `min-h-screen` - body fills at least the viewport height
- `flex flex-col` - vertical flex layout
- `flex-1` on main - main grows to fill available space, pushing footer down

## What I'd Change

Looking back, a few things I'd do differently:

1. **Add a real contact form.** The `mailto:` approach works but isn't great UX. A service like Formspree or Resend would be better.

2. **Add image optimization.** Blog post images should use Next.js `<Image>` for automatic optimization and lazy loading.

3. **Add a table of contents.** For longer posts, auto-generating a TOC from headings would help navigation.

4. **Add reading time.** A simple word count / 200 WPM calculation displayed under the post title.

## The Full Build Guide

If you want to build a similar site from scratch, I've written a comprehensive step-by-step guide that covers every command, every file, every decision: **[BUILD-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/chris2ao/cryptoflexllc/blob/main/BUILD-GUIDE.md)**.

It's about 1,300 lines and walks through scaffolding, shadcn/ui setup, the dark theme, all components, the MDX blog system, SEO, and deployment. Someone should be able to follow it and build the same site.

## Final Thoughts

Building a production website in a single session feels like it shouldn't be possible. But the combination of Next.js (which handles routing, rendering, and optimization), Tailwind (which eliminates the CSS bottleneck), shadcn/ui (which gives you accessible components), and Claude Code (which writes the code while you make the decisions) made it real.

The code is open source: [github.com/chris2ao/cryptoflexllc](https://github.com/chris2ao/cryptoflexllc). Fork it, modify it, learn from it.
